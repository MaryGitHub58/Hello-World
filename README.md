# Hello-World

Hi, I am glad to be here. I am Native American of the Osage Tribe, Red Eagle Clan, Pawhuska, OK Indian Village. I am thinking learning code could help tribal members maybe access language, food, medical, and educational apps that my team and I create.  Something that would be easy to use, even for our Elders.
